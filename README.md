# Sougene Daily Blog App

This a simple yet fast blog application built with Next.js and sanity with tailwind css. It has a revalidated caching which makes the app loading page super fast without delay.

The app studio editor is inserted directly into the application browser so we don't need to go to sanity website. I intend to give this application to my sister, which is why it is sougene daily blog 

technology used:
 * Next.js 13
 * Sanity v3
 * Typescript
 * React
 * tailwind css
 * Auth Functionality
